I moved to London in 2017 with my husband and have tried to find something to be passionate about ever since.

                  For almost two years I worked for an event meeting space company in London before going on maternity leave. I worked with great people and made good friends there, but while on maternity leave, the company struggled with the effects of the pandemic and they eventually decided to make a large part of their staff redundant as a result of that.

                  Becoming a mother was the most wonderful thing. Meeting Oliver can hardly be described in words. He has just turned two and he loves cars and dancing.

I started thinking about the world Oliver grows up in and how I could, maybe, make it better.

                  My coding journey started last year when I decided to experiment with online tutorials, in order to see if coding is something I can do and maybe become passionate about.

I wanted to put in the hours needed to become more comfortable with coding and during the last 4 months I wasn't able to spend as much time with my son.

            <p>
              It's been quite discouraging for me to find that most available entry-level coding jobs require experience and while learning through courses and tutorials I felt that there's no real path for me to succeed. Being part of the Founders and Coders community has drastically changed that perception. <br>
              I've enjoyed being part of the community so much in the past few weeks. I've grown a lot seeing other people's solution to the challenges I also solved in my own way and I've practiced working collaboratively on Zoom calls.

            <p>
              I found it unbelievably rewarding to talk about my solutions to others and do pair-programming sessions. I felt like even with my beginner knowledge I could share some ideas, thought and managed to help out. It was very powerfull and I'd like to get better at this. I knew that helping others makes us happier and helps create stronger communities, but experiencing it with coding felt unique.

              A friend of mine has graduated FAC in 2017. She is working for a company that's helping individuals all over the world find jobs and it feels extraordinary to be able to help people that way using tech skills. And it all started with FAC. I know it's early for me, but I would like to already thank the FAC community for the boost it gave me over the past few weeks. The daily challenges and the online meet-ups made me even more ambitious and have confirmed once again that I really want a career in tech.
